# Crystallization Mechanisms From Machine Learning
This repository hosts a collection of custom code and scripts accompanying the journal publication:

["Uncovering the effects of interface-induced ordering of liquid on crystal growth using Machine Learning"  
Rodrigo Freitas and Evan Reed.  
Nature Communications
arXiv:1909.05915](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05915).

If the script you need is not included here please contact the authors. Any code related to the paper will either be added to this repository (if it is of sufficient general interest) or sent directly to you.

## Requirements
In order to run the scripts contained here you will need to install [Ovito](https://www.ovito.org). If you only install Ovito's module through pip make sure to also have a compatible version of [numpy](https://numpy.org), [scipy](https://scipy.org), and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) also installed. Otherwise, if you downloaded Ovito's Python interpreter (named "ovitos") make sure to install scipy and scikit-learn modules by using
```
ovitos -m pip install scipy sklearn
```
